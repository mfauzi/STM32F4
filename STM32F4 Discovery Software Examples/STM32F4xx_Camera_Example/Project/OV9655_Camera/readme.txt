@par Example Description 
 
    This example shows how to use the DCMI to control the OV9655 Camera module(STM32F4DIS-CAM)
    Connetct with STM32F4DIS-BB board . 

    The OV955 camera (1.3 MegaPixel) is a low voltage CMOS device that provide the full
    functionality of a single-chip SXGA (1280x1024) camera and image processor in
    a small footprint package.

    This camera has an image array capable of operating at up to 15 frames per second 
    in SXGA resolution with complete user control over image quality, formatting and
    output data transfer. All required image processing functions are also programmable
    through the SCCB interface (I2C like protocol).

    In this example the DCMI is configured to interface with this 8 bit data camera
    in continuous mode. The I2C1 is used to configure the OV9655 in 8 bit RGB 5:6:5 mode. 
    The user can select between two resolutions QQVGA(160x120) or QVGA(320x240) in order 
    to display the captured image on the LCD(320x240), this selection is performed 
    in main.h file.
    All camera data received by the DCMI are transferred through the DMA and displayed
    on the LCD (connected to FSMC). As a result the CPU is free to execute other tasks.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example has been tested with the following environment: 
     - STM32F4DISCOVERY board
     - STM32F4DIS-BB for the Base Board
     - STM32F4DIS-CAM for the Camera module
     - STM32F4DIS-LCD for the LCD module
     - TF card (2GB or less than 2GB Kingston or SanDisk TF Card is recommended. 
       It should be formatted before using)
	   
  - Software development tools
    - EWARM V6.40
    - MDK-ARM V4.60
	
  - Hardware Set-up 
     - Mount STM32F4DISCOVERY board onto STM32F4DIS-BB board through CON1 and CON2
     - Insert a TF card into microSD slot CON6.
     - Mount STM32F4DIS-LCD module onto STM32F4DIS-BB board through CON3
     - Connect STM32F4DIS-CAM CON1 to STM32F4DIS-BB CON7 via FFC soft cable when the power 
       is turned off. Please make sure that STM32F4DIS-CAM module is mounted correctly
     - Connect the STM32F4DISCOVERY board to a PC with a 'USB type A to Mini-B' cable 
       through USB connector CN1 to power the board.
    
     @note: The jumpers JP1 and JP2 must be OFF.
