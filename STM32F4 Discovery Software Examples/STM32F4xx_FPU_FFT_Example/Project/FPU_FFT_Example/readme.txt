@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the Cortex-M4's FPU unit.

This example Demonstrates the calculation of the maximum energy bin in the frequency 
domain of the input signal with the use of Complex FFT, Complex Magnitude, and Maximum functions. 

if the Demon run ok, the LED6 will be flicker, otherwise the LED3 Will be turn on.

@par Hardware and Software environment 
 
  - This example has been tested with the following environment: 
     - STM32F4DISCOVERY board
	 
  - Software development tools
    - EWARM V6.40
    - MDK-ARM V4.60
	
  - Hardware Set-up 
    - Connect the STM32F4DISCOVERY board to a PC with a 'USB type A to Mini-B' cable 
      through USB connector CN1 to power the board


@par How to use it ? 

  In order to load the Project code, you have do the following:
   - EWARM
      - Open the Project.eww workspace
      - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
      - Load project image: Project->Debug
      - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)


   - MDK-ARM
      - Open the Project.uvproj project
      - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all target files
