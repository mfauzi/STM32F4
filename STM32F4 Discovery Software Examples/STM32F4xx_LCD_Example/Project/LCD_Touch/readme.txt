@par Example Description 

    This example describes how to proceed LCD touch srceen calibration.

    In this example, four points on the corner of touch screen need to be touch to complete 
    calibration. 

The program behaves as follows:
  - Click on calibration points accurately using a touch pen.
  - LCD will give massage whether calibration is OK. If calibration is OK, then MCU will
    enter Calibration_Test_Dispose function.
  - In this function LCD will display the value of point that touch pen point at.
    Both ADC values and coordinate values are displayed. 

@note User should click on calibration points in order.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example has been tested with the following environment: 
     - STM32F4DISCOVERY board
     - STM32F4DIS-BB for the Base Board
     - STM32F4DIS-LCD for the LCD module
	 
  - Software development tools
    - EWARM V6.40
    - MDK-ARM V4.60  
	
  - Hardware Set-up 
    - Mount STM32F4DISCOVERY board onto STM32F4DIS-BB board through CON1 and CON2
    - Mount STM32F4DIS-LCD module onto STM32F4DIS-BB board through CON3
    - Connect the STM32F4DISCOVERY board to a PC with a 'USB type A to Mini-B' cable 
      through USB connector CN1 to power the board.
