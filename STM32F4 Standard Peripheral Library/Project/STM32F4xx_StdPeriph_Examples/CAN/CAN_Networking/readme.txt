@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the CAN peripheral to send and receive 
CAN frames in normal mode. The sent frames are used to control Leds by pressing  
key push button.
	
The CAN serial communication link is a bus to which a number of units may be
connected. This number has no theoretical limit. Practically the total number
of units will be limited by delay times and/or electrical loads on the bus line.

This program behaves as follows:
  - After reset LED1 is ON
  - By Pressing on KEY Button : LED2 turns ON and all other Leds are OFF, on the N
    eval boards connected to the bus. 
  - Press on KEY Button again to send CAN Frame to command LEDn+1 ON, all other Leds 
    are OFF on the N eval boards.
    
@note This example is tested with a bus of 3 units. The same program example is 
      loaded in all units to send and receive frames.
@note Any unit in the CAN bus may play the role of sender (by pressing KEY button)
      or receiver.
	
	The CAN is configured as follow:
    - Bit Rate   = 1 Mbit/s  
    - CAN Clock  = external clock (HSE)
		- ID Filter  = All identifiers are allowed
		- RTR = Data
		- DLC = 1 byte
		- Data: Led number that should be turned ON

User can select CAN1 or CAN2 cell using the defines in main.h :
@code
#define USE_CAN1
/* #define USE_CAN2*/ 
@endcode

@par Hardware and Software environment  
  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices) and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) evaluation 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development 
    board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL and STM32437I-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.08, PI.09
      and PC.07 pins
    - Use KEY Push Button connected to PG15 
    - Connect a female/female CAN cable between at least 2 EVAL CAN connectors (CN10)
    - Depending on the CAN cell used, you have to configure the jumpers as follows:

  @verbatim    
       +-----------------------------------------------+
       |   Jumper    |    CAN1 used    |    CAN2 used  |
       +-----------------------------------------------+
       |   JP3       |       2-3       |       1-2     |
       |   JP10      |       2-3       |       1-2     |
       |   JP7       |       1-2       |       1-2     |
       |   JP9       |      fitted     |      fitted   |
       +-----------------------------------------------+
