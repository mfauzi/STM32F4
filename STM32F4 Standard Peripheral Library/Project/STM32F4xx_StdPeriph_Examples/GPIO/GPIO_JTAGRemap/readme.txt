@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the JTAG/SWD IOs as standard 
GPIOs and gives a configuration sequence. 

Note that once the JTAG/SWD IOs are disabled, the connection with the host debugger is
lost and cannot be re-established as long as the JTAG/SWD IOs remain disabled. 
To avoid this situation, the Key push-button is used to disable or not the JTAG/SWD IOs:
 1. Key push-button maintained pressed at reset: JTAG/SWD IOs disabled and LED1 turned ON
 2. Key push-button not pressed at reset: JTAG/SWD IOs unchanged and LED2 turned ON

Before starting this example, you should disconnect your JTAG/SWD probe and run 
the example in stand-alone mode.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices) and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) evaluation 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development 
    board. 

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up  
    - Use LED1 and LED2 connected respectively to PG.06 and PG.08
    - Use the Key push-button connected to pin PG15 (EXTI Line15)


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
