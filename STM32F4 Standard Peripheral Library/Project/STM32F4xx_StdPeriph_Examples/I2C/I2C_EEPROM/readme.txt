@par Example Description 

This firmware provides a basic example of how to use the I2C firmware library and
an associate I2C EEPROM driver to communicate with an I2C EEPROM device (here the
example is interfacing with M24C64 EEPROM)

I2C peripheral is configured in Master transmitter during write operation and in
Master receiver during read operation from I2C EEPROM. 

The peripheral used is I2C1 but can be configured by modifying the defines values
in stm324xg_eval.h (or stm324x7i_eval.h) file. The speed is set to 100kHz and can 
be configured by modifying the relative define in stm324xg_eval_i2c_ee.h 
(or stm324x7i_eval_i2c_ee.h) file.

For M24C64 devices all the memory is accessible through the two-bytes 
addressing mode and need to define block addresses. In this case, only the physical 
address has to be defined (according to the address pins (E0,E1 and E2) connection).
This address is defined in stm324xg_eval_i2c_ee.h (or stm324x7i_eval_i2c_ee.h) 
(default is 0xA0: E0, E1 and E2 tied to ground). 
The EEPROM addresses where the program start the write and the read operations 
is defined in the main.c file. 

First, the content of Tx1_Buffer is written to the EEPROM_WriteAddress1 and the
written data are read. The written and the read buffers data are then compared.
Following the read operation, the program waits that the EEPROM reverts to its 
Standby state. A second write operation is, then, performed and this time, Tx2_Buffer
is written to EEPROM_WriteAddress2, which represents the address just after the last 
written one in the first write. After completion of the second write operation, the 
written data are read. The contents of the written and the read buffers are compared.

All transfers are managed in DMA mode (except when 1-byte read/write operation is
required). Once sEE_ReadBuffer() or sEE_WriteBuffer() function is called, the 
use application may perform other tasks in parallel while Read/Write operation is
managed by DMA.

This example provides the possibility to use the STM324xG-EVAL (or STM32437I-EVAL) 
LCD screen for messages display (transfer status: Ongoing, PASSED, FAILED).
To enable this option uncomment the define USE_LCD in the main.h file.

@par Hardware and Software environment  
  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices) and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) evaluation 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development 
    board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL and STM32437I-EVAL Set-up 
    - Make sure the jumper JP24 "WP" is fitted on the board.
    - You may modify the timeout values "sEE_LONG_TIMEOUT" present in "stm324x7i_eval_i2c_ee.h" 
      depending on CPU frequency and application conditions.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Add the "stm324xg_eval_i2c_ee.c" file (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM3240_41_G_EVAL)
   or "stm324x7i_eval_i2c_ee.c" file (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x7i_EVAL)  
   to the project source list  
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
