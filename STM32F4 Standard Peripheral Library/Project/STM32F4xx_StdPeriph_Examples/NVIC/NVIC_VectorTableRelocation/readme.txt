@par Example Description 

  This example describes how to relocate the CortexM4 vector table in a specific 
  address other than the default Flash memory base address.
  This can be used to build program which will be loaded into Flash memory by an
  application previously programmed from the Flash memory base address. 
  Such application can be In-Application Programming (IAP) through USART, Ethernet
  or USB (Device Firmware Upgrade, DFU).
  These applications are available for download from the ST microcontrollers 
  website: <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>

  To build such application, some special configurations have to be performed:
  1. Set the application load address, using your toolchain linker file
  2. In the application code, relocate the vector table at the application load 
     address using the "NVIC_SetVectorTable" function from the misc.h/.c driver or
     by modifying the value of the constant "VECT_TAB_OFFSET" defined in "system_stm32f4xx.c" 
     file. 
  
  For example, when building an application to be loaded with the IAP through USART
  the application load address and vector table address must be set to 0x08004000.

  In this example, the associated program implements a "Delay" function based on
  SysTick end of count interrupt, and toggles four leds with timing defined by the
  "Delay" function.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices) and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) evaluation 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development 
    board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.08, PI.09
      and PC.07 pins.    


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain and setup your project configuration as follows
<ul>
    <li> MDK-ARM
         - In the project option menu, select 'Target' window and enter 0x08004000 
           as IROM1 start address
         - In the project option menu, select 'Linker' window and enter 0x08004000 
           as R/O base address

    <li> EWARM
         - Use "stm32f4xx_flash_offset.icf" as linker file

    <li> RIDE          
         - In the Application options -> script menu, set "Use Default Script File" 
           to "No" and use "stm32f4xx_flash_offset.ld" as Script File. 
           This linker is configured for STM32F4xx. It should be updated to use it
           with other STM32 devices. 
           
    <li> TASKING
         -In the project properties window, select C/C++ Build->settings node then 
         the  "Linker->Script file"  and use "stm32f4xx_flash_offset.lsl" as Script File.
         This linker is configured for STM32F4xx. It should be updated to be used
         with other STM32 devices. 

    <li> TrueSTUDIO 
         - In the project properties window, select C/C++ Build->settings node then 
           the C Linker->General node and use "stm32f4xx_flash_offset.ld" as Script File.
           This linker is configured for STM32F4xx. It should be updated to be used
           with other STM32 devices. 
          
</ul> 

 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
