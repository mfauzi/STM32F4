@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the STM32F4xx system to measure different
Low Power modes current consumption. The Low Power modes are:
  - Sleep Mode
  - STOP mode with RTC
  - STANDBY mode without RTC and BKPSRAM
  - STANDBY mode with RTC
  - STANDBY mode with RTC and BKPSRAM
  
To run this example, user has to follow the following steps:
 1. Select the Low power modes to be measured by uncommenting the corresponding
    line inside the stm32f4xx_lp_modes.h file.
    @code
       /*#define SLEEP_MODE*/
       /*#define STOP_MODE*/
       /*#define STANDBY_MODE*/
       #define STANDBY_RTC_MODE
       /*#define STANDBY_RTC_BKPSRAM_MODE*/
    @endcode       

 2. Use an external amperemeter to measure the IDD current. 

 3. This example can not be used in DEBUG mode,this is due to the fact that the 
    Cortex-M4 core is no longer clocked during low power mode so debugging 
    features are disbaled

Here below a detailed description of the example code:

  @verbatim

 1. After reset, the program waits for Key button connected to the PG.15 to be 
    pressed to enter the selected low power mode.
     - When the RTC is not used in the low power mode configuration, press
       again the Key button to exit the low power mode.
     - When the RTC is used, the wakeup from low power mode is automatically 
       generated by the RTC (after 4s).

 2. Low power modes description:

    - Sleep Mode
    ============  
            - System Running at PLL (168MHz)
            - Flash 5 wait state
            - Instruction and Data caches ON
            - Prefetch OFF       
            - Code running from Internal FLASH
            - All peripherals disabled.
            - Wakeup using EXTI Line (Key Button PG.15)

    - STOP Mode
    ===========
            - RTC Clocked by LSE or LSI
            - Regulator in LP mode
            - HSI, HSE OFF and LSI if not used as RTC Clock source
            - No IWDG
            - FLASH in deep power down mode
            - Automatic Wakeup using RTC clocked by LSE/LSI (after ~20s)

    - STANDBY Mode
    ==============
            - Backup SRAM and RTC OFF
            - IWDG and LSI OFF
            - Wakeup using WakeUp Pin (PA.00)
                        
    - STANDBY Mode with RTC clocked by LSE/LSI 
    ==========================================
            - RTC Clocked by LSE or LSI
            - IWDG OFF and LSI OFF  if not used as RTC Clock source
            - Backup SRAM OFF
            - Automatic Wakeup using RTC clocked by LSE/LSI (after ~20s)

    - STANDBY Mode with RTC clocked by LSE/LSI and BKPSRAM
    ======================================================
            - RTC Clocked by LSE or LSI
            - Backup SRAM ON
            - IWDG OFF
            - Automatic Wakeup using RTC clocked by LSE/LSI (after ~20s)

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/41xx and STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL(STM32F40xx/41xx Devices) 
    and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/437x Devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1 connected  to PG.06 pin.
