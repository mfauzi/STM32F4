@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the programmable voltage detector using
an external interrupt line. In this example, EXTI line 16 is configured to generate 
an interrupt on each rising or falling edge of the PVD output signal (which 
indicates that the Vdd voltage is below the PVD threshold).
In the interrupt routine a led connected to a specific GPIO pin is toggled every 
time the voltage drops below or above the target threshold.

A LED connected to a specific GPIO pin is toggling to indicate that the system 
is in RUN.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/41xx and STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.
  
  - HW Set-up
    - Connect a LED to PG.06 pin (will be referred to by LED1 in the example code)
    - Connect a LED to PG.08 pin (will be referred to by LED2 in the example code)
    @note This example can't run on the STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL board.
  
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
