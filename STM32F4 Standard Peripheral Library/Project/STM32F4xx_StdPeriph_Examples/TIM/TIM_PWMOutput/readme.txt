@par Example Description

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral in PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) 
mode.

The TIM3CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock / 2 (Hz), to get TIM3 counter
clock at 21 MHz the Prescaler is computed as following:
   - Prescaler = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 168 MHz for STM32F4xx Devices.

The TIM3 is running at 30 KHz: TIM3 Frequency = TIM3 counter clock/(ARR + 1)
                                              = 21 MHz / 666 = 31.530 KHz
The TIM3 CCR1 register value is equal to 333, so the TIM3 Channel 1 generates a 
PWM signal with a frequency equal to 30 KHz and a duty cycle equal to 50%:
TIM3 Channel1 duty cycle = (TIM3_CCR1/ TIM3_ARR + 1)* 100 = 50%

The TIM3 CCR2 register value is equal to 249, so the TIM3 Channel 2 generates a 
PWM signal with a frequency equal to 30 KHz and a duty cycle equal to 37.5%:
TIM3 Channel2 duty cycle = (TIM3_CCR2/ TIM3_ARR + 1)* 100 = 37.5%

The TIM3 CCR3 register value is equal to 166, so the TIM3 Channel 3 generates a 
PWM signal with a frequency equal to 30 KHz and a duty cycle equal to 25%:
TIM3 Channel3 duty cycle = (TIM3_CCR3/ TIM3_ARR + 1)* 100 = 25%

The TIM3 CCR4 register value is equal to 83, so the TIM3 Channel 4 generates a 
PWM signal with a frequency equal to 30 KHz and a duty cycle equal to 12.5%:
TIM3 Channel4 duty cycle = (TIM3_CCR4/ TIM3_ARR + 1)* 100 = 12.5%

The PWM waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/41xx and STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL(STM32F40xx/41xx Devices) 
    and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/437x Devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:
        - PC.06: (TIM3_CH1)
        - PC.07: (TIM3_CH2)
        - PC.08: (TIM3_CH3)
        - PC.09: (TIM3_CH4)
