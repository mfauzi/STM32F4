@par Example Description 

  This example demonstrates the use of the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller 
  (NVIC) IRQ Channels configuration and how to mask/activate different IRQs: 

  - Configuration of 3 timers (TIM2..TIM4) to generate an interrupt on each counter 
    update event.

  - The three timers are linked to their correspondent Update IRQ channel.

  - Assignment of an ascendant IRQ priority for each IRQ channel :
     - TIM2 has a preemption priority of 0
     - TIM3 has a preemption priority of 1
     - TIM4 has a preemption priority of 2
     
  - In each interrupt routine: 
     - TIM2 toggles a LED1 each 1s 
     - TIM3 toggles a LED2 each 2s 
     - TIM4 toggles a LED3 each 3s 

  - The KEY and Tamper buttons are used to boost the execution priority as follows:

    - The KEY button is used in GPIO mode and at each KEY button press, the execution 
      priority is raised to 0 and turn LED4 ON. This prevents all exceptions with 
      configurable priority from activating, other than through the Hard Fault fault 
      escalation mechanism. As consequence, all LEDs stop toggling as TIM2, TIM3 
      and TIM4 IRQs are prevented from activation. 
    
      Pressing again the KEY button will release the priority boosting, turn LED4 
      OFF and will allow all exceptions with configurable priority to be activated 
      and TIM2, TIM3 and TIM4 can be generated again and the LEDs restart toggling.
    
      This execution priority is made using the CMSIS functions "__disable_irq()" 
      and "__enable_irq()". 
      These two functions are managing the Cortex-M4 PRIMASK special register.

    - The TAMPER button is used in EXTI mode and at each TAMPER button press, the
      execution priority is masked to 0x40 using the BASEPRI register. 
      A non-zero value will act as a priority mask, affecting the execution priority 
      when the priority defined by BASEPRI is the same or higher than the current 
      executing priority. 
      As consequence, LED2 and LED3 stop toggling as TIM3 and TIM4 IRQs are 
      prevented from activation. 
      Pressing again the TAMPER button will configure the BASEPRI register to 0, 
      thus it has no effect on the current priority and TIM3 and TIM4 can be 
      generated again and LED2 and LED3 restart toggling.
    
      This execution priority is made using the CMSIS functions "__set_BASEPRI()". 
      This function is managing the Cortex-M4 BASEPRI special register.
      Setting the BASEPRI register has no effect when the execution priority is
      raised to 0 using the "__disable_irq()" function.

@note These mechanisms only affect the group priority. They have no effect on 
      the sub-priority. The sub-priority is only used to sort pending exception 
      priorities, and does not affect active exceptions.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices) and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) evaluation 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development 
    board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.08, PI.09
      and PC.07 pins
    - Use the KEY push-button connected to pin PG15 (EXTI Line15)
    - Use the TAMPER push-button connected to pin PC13 (EXTI Line13)
