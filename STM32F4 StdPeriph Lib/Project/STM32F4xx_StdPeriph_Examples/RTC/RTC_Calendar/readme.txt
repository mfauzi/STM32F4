@par Example Description 

  This example demonstrates and explains how to use the RTC peripheral.
  As an application example, it demonstrates how to setup the RTC peripheral, in 
  terms of prescaler and interrupts, to be used to keep time and to generate 
  alarm interrupt. 

  One from the following clock can be used as RTC clock source (uncomment the
  corresponding define in main.c): 
    - LSE oscillator clock usually delivered by a 32.768 kHz quartz.
    - LSI oscillator clock
  
  The RTC is in the backup (BKP) domain, still powered by VBAT when VDD is switched off,
  so the RTC configuration is not lost if a battery is connected to the VBAT pin. 
  A key value is written in backup data register 0 to indicate if the RTC is already
  configured.

  The program behaves as follows:

  1. After startup the program checks the backup data register 0 value:
     - BKP_DR0 value not correct: (RTC_BKP_DR0 value is not correct or has not yet
       been programmed when the program is executed for the first time) the RTC is
       configured.
    
     - BKP_DR0 value correct: this means that the RTC is configured and the time
       and Alarm A are displayed on Debugger.

  2. When an External Reset occurs the BKP domain is not reset and the RTC configuration
     is not lost. LED4 is On.

  3. When power on reset occurs:
     - If a battery is connected to the VBAT pin: the BKP domain is not reset and
       the RTC configuration is not lost. LED3 is On.
      
     - If no battery is connected to the VBAT pin: the BKP domain is reset and the
       RTC configuration is lost.

  4. When an RTC Alarm A event occurs the RTC Alarm interrupt is generated and the
     LED1 is toggled.
   
   - When Tamper button is pressed, the current time is displayed.
   - When WakeUp button is pressed, the current alarm A is displayed. 

  LED2 is turned ON when the RTC configuration is done correctly.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices) and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) evaluation 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development 
    board. 
    
  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use the TAMPER push button connected to PC.13 pin (EXTI Line13).
    - Use the WAKEUP push button connected to PA.00 pin (EXTI Line0).
    - Make sure that jumper JP19 is in position 2-3 to connect the 3V battery to VBAT pin
    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
